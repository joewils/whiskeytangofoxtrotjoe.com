      <a name="why"></a><h2>{% include icon.html %} Why Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?</h2>

      <p>Prior to starting WTF, I would recommend WP Engine for WordPress hosting and support.  Like all great companies, once they reach a certain size the marketing and business folks take over. The engineers who started the company get pushed aside and suddenly what once was a simple, yet best in class managed WordPress hosting company becomes something else. WPEngine describes themselves as a: "WordPress Digital Experience Platform".  What the f*ck does that even mean?  Time to start searching for yet another managed provider.  </p>

      <h2>Three weeks later...</h2>

      <p>This is painful.  Apparently I'm the only developer who wants "plain old WordPress" hosting.  I don't need or want your proprietary plugins or management features.  Just give me secure shell access and stay out of the way. Stop modifying core WordPress.  If your modifications are so great, submit a pull request and share with with the community.</p>

      <p>What the f*ck Joe? Let's roll up our sleeves and build a managed WordPress hosting servoce that monitors uptime, manages updates, maintains off-site backups, preserves unlimited post and page revisions, persistently scans for vulnerabilities, and performs really well.</p>
